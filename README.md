In the advent of the global rise in population and economic growth, water scarcity has
emerged as a pressing quagmire that needs to be considered from all affected disciplines:
human wellbeing, economic development, and environmental sustainability etc. (WBCSD
2009; Cosgrove & Loucks, 2015; United Nations, 2018). We can see this reflected in
Sustainable Development Goal 6, which seeks to ensure the availability and sustainable
management of water and sanitation for all. It has been argued that the assessment of
water security positively contributed to all SDGs, especially SDG3 (good health) and SDG2
(zero hunger); hence, its centrality in the global achievement of sustainability is vitalized in
companies through well-defined corporate social responsibility strategies (Taka, M. et al.,
2021). We see a parallel path in the management of water resources in corporations, where
stewardship has taken motion and consequently given rise to multiple frameworks, including
AWS, WWFâ€™s Water Stewardship Ladder, and The CEO Water Mandate, that track their
performance towards the comprehensive achievement of Water Stewardship. The multitude
of these frameworks has given rise to the problem of fragmentation in their implementation,
British Standards Institution (BSI). (2023); thus, in this research, we seek to come
to a unified way of analyzing water reports in adherence to all these standards. Moreover,
Research has been done to analyze the text data of companies to test their adherence to the
Sustainable Development Goals Kang, H., & Kim, J., 2021; Amini, M., et al., 2018).
However, the focus on the specific aspect of water stewardship is limited in the literature
to only thematic content analysis. Thus, we seek to utilize Natural Language Processing to
analyze the reporting and uncover an interpretable approach to its jargon-heavy approach.
